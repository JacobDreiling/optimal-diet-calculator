Successful in some ways, not others

People are always saying "eat healthy" but it is surprisingly difficult to find a combination of foods that fully satisfies one's nutritional needs (most especially without using computers). In 2019, I attempted several methods to solve this problem for my own nutrition. This method was the most successful (though I ended up not using it since there were still issues).

A added the amounts of each micro and macro nutrient I need into the 'Food data' file. It was pretty frustrating trying to find a suitable database of simple foods, so I ended up **manually** entering several foods' nutrition info into Food data. This diet calculator lets you pick which nutrients (for example, sodium) you want to be matched exactly. If too many are selected, there may be no solutions with the foods I entered. The solutions are sorted based on how close the remaining nutrients are to my personal requirements.

I included an example file with results for one such combo of nutrients to be matched. The program is actually pretty good at finding nutritious combinations of foods. Unfortunately, it has a few too many limitations to be useful for me. It's barely able to match nutrition requirements, let alone consider costs, practicality (some solutions included large amounts of certain foods), and food preferences.

In the end, I just went for a popular meal replacement instead. But I'm still very proud of this program's performance.
